# Job-Trackr-CRUD-App

I built a web application today from scratch called Job Trackr.<br><br>

I created this application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the purpose of helping other fellow 
engineers and applicants easily track all of their job submissions, offers, and rejections. <br><br>

The applicaton allows you to add, edit and delete entries for the options below:<br>
-Company name<br>
-Position Title<br>
-Date Applied<br>
-Method of Application<br>
-Salary<br>
-City / State<br>
-Status<br>
<br><br>
I built the wireframe in a sketchpad first and then I wrote out the Psuedo Code for the JavaScript to break it down in smaller chunks.<br><br>
I applied CRUD functions to this project to give users the ability to make updates as the job process progresses.<br><br>
I also implimented key frames in my CSS so the title text changes colors when you hover over it.<br><br>

I will continue to add new features to this app because I know it will be a useful tool to keep my life more organized and make this software engineering journey less of a hassle.<br><br>
